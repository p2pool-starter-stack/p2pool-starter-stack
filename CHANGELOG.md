# Changelog

All notable changes to **Pithead** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Pithead ships as **one product, one version** — the version lives in the top-level
[`VERSION`](VERSION) file and every released image is tagged with it. Releases are cut
per the process in [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A four-tier test strategy for simulating every runtime situation (#54), documented in
  `docs/testing-strategy.md` with a full scenario catalog:
  - **Live config-matrix suite** (`tests/integration/`, tier 4) that drives a real, synced
    server through the config matrix and asserts the stack behaves — containers healthy, nodes
    synced, miners mining, dashboard reading correct live state, `status` exit codes, secrets
    preserved. Runs over SSH or `--local`; the blocking pre-release gate. A `--fault-injection`
    phase deliberately breaks monerod (stop / SIGSTOP / remove) to assert `pithead status`'
    down/unhealthy/missing verdicts and the failover→recovery cycle. `make test-integration`.
  - **Controllable fake monerod/Tari + a contract test** (`tests/integration/fakes/`, tier 2)
    that points the real dashboard clients at the fakes and asserts they parse every state —
    docker-free, runs on every PR. `make test-fakes`.
  - **Fake-daemon docker mini-stack** (`tests/integration/mini-stack/`, tier 3) running the real
    dashboard + docker-control proxy against the fakes, asserting sync hold/release and
    node-down reject/readmit end-to-end with real containers. `make test-mini-stack`.
  - New dashboard unit tests for the required-Tari sync gate, the #35-latch × #31-failover
    interaction, and simultaneous double outages.
  - A generated **test inventory** (`docs/test-inventory.md`, `make test-inventory`) listing
    every test/scenario across all suites, kept honest by a CI drift check.
  - `UPDATE_INTERVAL` is now env-configurable (lets the mini-stack loop fast in CI).
- Per-worker share stats in the dashboard's Workers table: accepted / rejected (with invalid
  folded in) counts per rig, a **⚠** flag on a high reject rate, and a **Proxy totals** footer
  (pool-wide accepted / rejected / invalid + best difficulty) collected from the xmrig-proxy
  `/summary` endpoint. The proxy already reported all of this; it was being parsed and discarded
  (#82).
- Responsive dashboard layout: the web UI now reflows for phone-sized screens — the header
  stacks, the card grid collapses to a single column, the disk bar goes full-width, and the
  workers table scrolls horizontally within its card instead of overflowing the page. Desktop
  is unchanged.
- Dashboard branding (#81): the header now leads with the Pithead mark + wordmark and demotes
  the host IP to a subtitle, and a hero KPI band above the dashboard surfaces the headline
  numbers — total hashrate, shares in the PPLNS window, blocks found, XvB tier, and mining mode.
- Release & versioning scaffold: top-level `VERSION` file (single source of truth),
  this changelog, and `docs/releasing.md` documenting the release process. The
  GHCR publishing pipeline and `make release` / `pithead release` command are still
  to come (see `docs/releasing.md`).
- `p2pool.stratum_bind` config option to choose which host interface the stratum port
  (`3333`) is published on (default `0.0.0.0`; set a LAN IP or `127.0.0.1` to narrow it).
- Liveness healthcheck for the p2pool container (probes the stratum port), so a stalled
  p2pool is now visible in `pithead status` and the dashboard.

### Changed

- Hardened the leaf containers (caddy, xmrig-proxy, dashboard, docker-proxy, docker-control)
  with `no-new-privileges`. All except the dashboard also `cap_drop: [ALL]` (caddy keeps
  `NET_BIND_SERVICE` for `:80`/`:443`); the dashboard keeps its default capabilities because it
  writes its SQLite history into a host-user-owned volume as root. Caddy and the two Docker
  socket proxies additionally run with a read-only root filesystem (ephemeral `tmpfs` for
  scratch; Caddy's certs persist in `caddy_data`).

### Security

- The monerod RPC credentials are no longer interpolated into the compose healthcheck command
  (they were readable via `docker inspect`); the healthcheck now reads them from the container
  environment via a script.
- Documented that the stratum port defaults to all interfaces and should be firewalled to the
  LAN — see [Connecting Miners › Firewall](docs/workers.md#firewall).
