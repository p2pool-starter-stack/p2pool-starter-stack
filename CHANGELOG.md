# Changelog

All notable changes to **Pithead** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Pithead ships as **one product, one version** — the version lives in the top-level
[`VERSION`](VERSION) file and every released image is tagged with it. Releases are cut
per the process in [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Dashboard header shows the host's **IP address** next to the hostname when the configured
  `dashboard.host` is a name, as `hostname @ ip` (e.g. `pithead.local @ 192.168.1.42`), so you can still reach the
  dashboard when the hostname doesn't resolve from your phone or another machine on the LAN. The
  address is detected on the host (the dashboard runs `network_mode: host`), and is omitted when
  the host is already an IP or can't be determined (#119).
- Dashboard header now shows which build is running, as a muted badge on both the
  syncing and main screens: a clean release shows `vX.Y.Z` (from the top-level
  `VERSION` file), while any dev/working-tree build shows `dev · branch @ hash` so
  it's never mistaken for a release. The version is baked into the dashboard image at
  build time (build-arg → env + OCI labels), so the running container is
  self-describing.
- Per-worker share stats in the dashboard's Workers table: accepted / rejected (with invalid
  folded in) counts per rig, a **⚠** flag on a high reject rate, and a **Proxy totals** footer
  (pool-wide accepted / rejected / invalid + best difficulty) collected from the xmrig-proxy
  `/summary` endpoint. The proxy already reported all of this; it was being parsed and discarded
  (#82).
- Responsive dashboard layout: the web UI now reflows for phone-sized screens — the header
  stacks, the card grid collapses to a single column, the disk bar goes full-width, and the
  workers table scrolls horizontally within its card instead of overflowing the page. Desktop
  is unchanged.
- Dashboard branding (#81): the header now leads with the Pithead mark + wordmark and demotes
  the host IP to a subtitle, and a hero KPI band above the dashboard surfaces the headline
  numbers — total hashrate, shares in the PPLNS window, blocks found, XvB tier, and mining mode.
- Release & versioning scaffold: top-level `VERSION` file (single source of truth),
  this changelog, and `docs/releasing.md` documenting the release process. The
  GHCR publishing pipeline and `make release` / `pithead release` command are still
  to come (see `docs/releasing.md`).
- `p2pool.stratum_bind` config option to choose which host interface the stratum port
  (`3333`) is published on (default `0.0.0.0`; set a LAN IP or `127.0.0.1` to narrow it).
- Liveness healthcheck for the p2pool container (probes the stratum port), so a stalled
  p2pool is now visible in `pithead status` and the dashboard.

### Changed

- Hardened the leaf containers (caddy, xmrig-proxy, dashboard, docker-proxy, docker-control)
  with `no-new-privileges`. All except the dashboard also `cap_drop: [ALL]` (caddy keeps
  `NET_BIND_SERVICE` for `:80`/`:443`); the dashboard keeps its default capabilities because it
  writes its SQLite history into a host-user-owned volume as root. Caddy and the two Docker
  socket proxies additionally run with a read-only root filesystem (ephemeral `tmpfs` for
  scratch; Caddy's certs persist in `caddy_data`).

### Security

- The monerod RPC credentials are no longer interpolated into the compose healthcheck command
  (they were readable via `docker inspect`); the healthcheck now reads them from the container
  environment via a script.
- Documented that the stratum port defaults to all interfaces and should be firewalled to the
  LAN — see [Connecting Miners › Firewall](docs/workers.md#firewall).
